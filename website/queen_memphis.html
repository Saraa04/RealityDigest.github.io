		<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3> 
		<h4>Many people around the world were shocked and saddened by the sudden and tragic death of <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>. However, suspicions arose that the British Royal Family did not fully share in this grief. The apprehensions over the Royals’ lack of public sorrow and concern for their subjects created an immense public relations problem, provoking the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> of England to give an unprecedented speech to rebut those innuendos. This essay investigates this highly public instance of royal public relations. <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">The Queen</span> used two primary image repair strategies (denial, bolstering) and two minor ones (defeasibility, transcendence). We evaluate her image repair effort as generally well conceived, and effective. <span class="mention person" about="WilliamLBenoit">William L.

		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<p>Our image, reputation, or face is vital to our social and emotional well-being. <em>"Image"</em> is the perception of a person (or group, or organization) held by others. One's image is influenced by one's own words and actions, as well as by the discourse and behavior of others. One's good name is very important to our emotional well-being, and having a positive reputation is very important in our dealings with others. <span class="mention person" about="Higgins">Higgins</span> and <span class="mention person" about="Snyder">Snyder</span>, for example, acknowledge that "people have a basic need to maintain positive images. " [1] Threats to our reputation frequently compel us to attempt to repair our reputation: whenever we perceive that our image is at risk, we are inclined to take restorative action. <span class="mention person" about="Schlenker">Schlenker</span> recognizes that predicaments can "damage" one's identity, "adversely affecting relationships" with others? Accordingly, as <span class="mention person" about="Goffman">Goffman</span> explains, "When a face has been threatened, face-work must be done. " [3] Face-work is persuasive discourse designed to restore a blemished image.</p>
		
		<p>This phenomenon, motivation to repair a tarnished image, occurs throughout human behavior. Research has revealed that politicians, corporations, 5 and sports/entertainment figures [6] all produce image restoration discourse when their image is threatened. But do Queens and other members of royalty need to concern themselves with the opinions of mere commoners?</p>
		
		<p>The events following the death of <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>—and the Royal family's response to suspicions, innuendo, and criticism—illustrate the claim that the need for public relations work is pervasive. Tragically, <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>, Princess of Wales, died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident in the early morning hours of Sunday, August 31, <time datetime="1997">1997</time>. British citizens awoke Sunday morning to the shocking and completely unexpected news that <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span> was dead. In addition to explanations of the accident, the news media carried a brief statement issued by the Royal Family "confirming the death" of the <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span>.[7]</p>
		
		<p>While the Royal Family's initial public response to <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death may have been simple and muted, Britons responded with an enormous public demonstration of grief. <span class="mention place">Kensington Palace</span>, <span class="mention place">Buckingham Palace</span>, and <span class="mention place">Westminster Abbey</span> became instant shrines to <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s memory and were deluged with flowers, cards, candles, and other remembrances of her. Stereotypes of the staid Briton with the "stiffupper lip" were replaced by video images of them weeping over their loss, and waiting in long lines to sign the books of condolence.</p>
		
		<p>Their grief, however, was soon mixed with increasing anger directed toward the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> and her family. News stories and letters to <span class="mention organization">The [<span class="mention place">London</span>] Times</span> editor began to reveal public displeasure with the Royal Family's lack of response to <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death. One critique focused on the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s lack of public display of grief, and as the British newspaper <span class="mention organization">The Independent</span> put it, "if only the royals dared weep with the people. " [8] Did the Royal Family even care about <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s tragic death?</p>
		
		<p>The more stinging rebuke, however, chastised the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> for failing to acknowledge her subjects' overwhelming grief. [9] Public judgments of inadequacy were stoked by several events. First, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> remained isolated in <span class="mention place">Balmoral Castle</span>, <span class="mention place">Scotland</span>, during the first several days following <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death, emerging only once on Sunday morning to attend church services and displaying no outward sign of grief over this tragedy. As one writer put it, "It is not understandable, indeed inexplicable, why. . . members of the Royal Family. . . should not have left <span class="mention place">Balmoral</span> and talked directly to people. [10] The belief was that the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> and her *Queen*</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>family should acknowledge their subjects' feelings. Second, the lack of a Royal Standard or Union Jack flying over <span class="mention place">Buckingham Palace</span> in <span class="mention place">London</span> also symbolized the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s lack of sensitivity to her subjects' grief. [Il] In the other residence in <span class="mention place">Scotland</span>, the flag flew, but not at halfmast. As <span class="mention organization">The Times</span> reported, "pictures of the Royal Standard flying at full-mast at <span class="mention place">Balmoral Castle</span> . have further fueled a widespread feeling that the Royal Family is showing insumcient respect for the death o?' <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>. [12] Although tradition holds that the Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast, even when a King or Queen dies, as <span class="mention organization">The Times</span> reported, Britons "were in no mood to observe the rules of royal protocol" regarding appropriate times for flying flags. [13] The clearest representations of public indignation were the headlines of <span class="mention place">London</span> newspapers: "Your People Are Suffering. Speak to Us, Ma'am," "Where Is Our Queen? Where is Her Flag?" "Show Us You Care." I There was a widespread belief that the Royal Family was simply ignoring their subjects, creating a royal public relations nightmare.</p>
		
		<p>According to the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s spokespersons she was genuinely hurt by the criticisms that suggested she was indifferent to Britons' suffering. [15] Nonetheless, the "ferocity" of the attacks [16] all but forced her to respond. <span class="mention place">Buckingham Palace</span> "issued a statement acknowledging the enormous wave of public feeling for the <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span>' and several Royal Family members—including the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> and <span class="mention person" about="PrincePhilip">Prince Philip</span>—returned to <span class="mention place">London</span> and engaged in a "burst of public activity" intended to communicate sympathy and solidarity. [18] In a significant break with Royal Protocol, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> also ordered the Royal Standard to fly at half-mast during <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s funeral.</p>
		
		<p>Even more remarkable than the decision to fly the Royal Standard at halfmast, however, was the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s agreement to address the British public on the evening before the funeral. As <span class="mention organization">The Times</span> put it, "The Palace has at last grasped the urgent need for a direct personal message." In the <span class="mention place">United States</span> we are accustomed to the President addressing the public frequently. This is decidedly not the case in <span class="mention place">England</span>, where the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> makes only two scheduled public addresses per year: the annual Christmas address and the Opening of Parliament. Indeed, in the 45 years since <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> ascended the British throne, she made only one other unscheduled public address to her subjects. [20] Further, while Britons certainly understood the importance of the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s address, television news anchors in the <span class="mention place">United States</span> also "went out of their way to bridge the cultural gap and explain how historic the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s break with protocol was." [21] <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span>'s speech was thus an extraordinary response to the growing feeling of hostility among her subjects—and a clear signal of her concern over matters of public relations.</p>
		
		<p>The circumstances leading to the public address <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> made on September 5, <time datetime="1997">1997</time>, were virtually unprecedented. As Phillips explained, "The public and the press had so harshly scolded the royal family, and <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> in particular, for making no public expression. . . of its feelings that the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> was forced to capitulate." [22] Thus, the address itself, designed to restore the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s damaged public image, deserves analysis to determine whether her response was appropriate and successful. The Royal Family is an institution that, like any corporation or other organization, must be concerned with public relations. However, rhetorical examinations of royal addresses are rare, perhaps owing to the infrequency with which these discourses occur. One of the few studies of this kind of situation is <span class="mention person" about="Ryan">Ryan</span>'s evaluation of <span class="mention person" about="KingEdwardVIII">King Edward Vlll</span>'s <time datetime="1938">1938</time> apologia following accusations by Prime Minister <span class="mention person" about="StanleyBaldwin">Stanley Baldwin</span> over <span class="mention person" about="KingEdwardVIII">Edward</span>'s decision to marry a commoner. [23] To analyze <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span>'s public relations effort we first explain the theory of image restoration discourse. Then we describe and analyze the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s discourse. Finally, we evaluate the rhetorical effectiveness ofher rhetorical response and discuss the implications of this analysis.</p>
		
		<h3>THEORY OF IMAGE RESTORATION DISCOURSE</h3>
		
		<p>The communication literature offers approaches to understanding image repair rhetoric. [24] <span class="mention person" about="WilliamLBenoit">Benoit</span>'s typology of image repair strategies synthesizes this material into a more comprehensive theory. [25] Because this typology has been described elsewhere we will briefly sketch the strategies available to rhetors here.</p>
		
		<p>As <span class="mention person" about="Ryan">Ryan</span> correctly observes, image repair is best understood as a response to a prior attack (or to suspicions). [26] A persuasive attack has two key elements: ( 1 ) the accused must be seen as responsible for an act; (2) that act must be viewed as offensive by a salient audience. [27] Most of the rhetor's options stem directly from these nvo essential elements of an attack. There are five general forms of image repair, several with specific variants (see Table l ).</p>

		<h2>Denial</h2>
		<p>Simple denial has three forms. A person accused of wrong doing may deny that the offensive act occurred, deny that he or she committed the act, or deny that the act is harmful. Any of these forms of denial, if accepted by the audience, can help repair the rhetor's image. A related option is for the rhetor to attempt to shift the blame. If another person (or group, or organization) really committed the offensive act, the accused should not be blamed.</p>
		
		<h2>Evade Responsibility</h2>
		<p>Attempting to evade responsibility for the offensive act has four versions. One may claim the offensive act was a reasonable response to someone else's offensive act (usually an act of the alleged victim) and that this response is a reasonable reaction to that provocation. Defeasibility claims that the actor did not have the knowledge or ability to avoid committing the offensive act. One may also suggest that the offense occurred by accident. Fourth, the rhetor can explain that the act was performed with good intentions.</p>
		
		<h2>Reduce Offensiveness</h2>
		<p>One can attempt to reduce the apparent offensiveness of the act in six ways. First, a rhetor can bolster his or her image so as to strengthen the audience's positive feelings toward him or her, hopefully offsetting the negative feelings arising from the wrongful act. Minimization suggests that the act in question is not as offensive as it seems. Differentiation is an attempt to distinguish the act from other similar but more offensive actions. In comparison, the act performed by the rhetor may not seem so bad. Transcendence attempts to justify the act by placing it in a more favorable context. One accused of wrong doing could attack his or her accusers, to reduce the credibility of the accusations (or suggest the victim deserved what happened). Compensation offers to give the victim money, goods, or services to help mitigate the negative feelings toward the rhetor.</p>
		
		<h2>Corrective Action</h2>
		<p>Corrective action is a commitment to repair the damage from the offensive act. This can take two forms: restoring the state of affairs before the offensive act and preventing the recurrence of the offensive act.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Mortification</h2>
		<p>The last strategy is to admit committing the offensive act and to ask for forgiveness. A sincere apology may help restore the rhetor's image. With a basic understanding of the concepts that guided our analysis of the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s speech in hand, we can turn to discussing the fruits of our analysis.</p>
		
		
		<h3><span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">QUEEN ELIZABETH</span>'S IMAGE REPAIR EFFORT</h3>
		
		<p>The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s discourse [28] enacted four image repair strategies: two predominated (denial, bolstering), while two others played relatively minor roles (defeasibility, transcendence). We will discuss each strategy separately in this section.</p>
		
		<h2>Denial</h2>
		<p>First and foremost, the simple fact that the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> gave this speech, unprecedented as it was, functioned to deny the accusation that the Royal Family did not care about <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death or about their subjects' feelings of grief. As such, this speech is an instance of rhetorical enactment.[29] As <span class="mention person" about="Campbell">Campbell</span> and <span class="mention person" about="Jamieson">Jamieson</span> note, the fact that <span class="mention person" about="BarbaraJordan">Barbara Jordan</span>, an African-American woman, could be selected to give the keynote speech at a presidential nominating convention demonstrates that minorities have come a long way toward being integrated into the political mainstream. Similarly, the fact that <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> decided to give an unprecedented speech— before she ever spoke a word (or, as long as she wasn't offensive, almost regardless of what she said)—was a powerful rhetorical act expressing concern over <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span> and for her subjects' feelings. As in <span class="mention person" about="Campbell">Campbell</span> and <span class="mention person" about="Jamieson">Jamieson</span>'s explanation of <span class="mention person" about="BarbaraJordan">Barbara Jordan<span>'s Democratic keynote, the sheer act of <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> delivering a speech on this topic "embodies the position she is arguing" ; in this case, that position is that the Royal Family cares about <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span> and their subjects. Tradition-bound as the British monarchy is, surely it was not easy to make the decision to give such an unparalleled appearance. The British people could see on their televisions and hear on their radios that their <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> really did care about the <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span> and about them and their feelings. The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> was willing to break with tradition, to try something new, to reassure her subjects. This was a moment of high drama, and it functioned to deny the reproaches of the Royal Family.</p>
		
		<p>Examination of the speech itself reveals that the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> responded more directly to the criticisms. Several of her passages addressed the charge that the Royal Family did not care about <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s tragic death. The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> characterized the news as "dreadful," thus revealing her attitude. She reassured her audience that she cared about the fallen <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span>: "First, I want to pay tribute to <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span> myself. She was an exceptional and gifted human being. In good times and bad, she never lost her capacity to smile and laugh, nor to inspire others with her warmth and kindness. "Later, she explicitly declared that "I admired and respected her—for her energy and commitment to others, and especially for her devotion to her two boys." Similarly, <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> said, "I share in your determination to cherish her memory." These statements function directly to deny the accusations that the Royal Family was uncaring of <<span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> set to rest suspicions that she did not care about her subjects' feelings. She was aware of the "overwhelming expression of sadness at <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death." The speech suggested that she and her subjects could share in the grieving process: "I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life. " Thus, the speech, in its specific details as well as being an unprecedented rhetorical act, directly denied the accusations directed toward the Royal Family.</p>
		
		<p>Although not part of the address itself, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s decision to lower the Royal Standard over <span class="mention place">Buckingham Palace</span> to half-mast during <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s funeral also functioned as a rhetorical act to deny charges of indifference. The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s actions communicated to her subjects that she cared about their perceptions of her, to the point of disregarding royal protocol.</p>
		
		<h2>Bolstering</h2>
		<p>Several passages in the message functioned to bolster the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s image. She assured her subjects of her sincerity, explaining, "What I say to you now, as your <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> and as a grandmother, I say from my heart." <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> revealed that the Royal Family had been at <span class="mention place">Balmoral</span> to comfort <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s children: "This week at <span class="mention place">Balmoral</span>, we have all been trying to help <span class="mention person" about="PrinceWilliam">William</span> and <span class="mention person" about="PrinceHarry">Harry</span> come to terms with the devastating loss that they and the rest of us have suffered." She spoke directly to the bereaved viewers, thanking them for their outpouring of emotions for the entire Royal Family: "This is also an opportunity for me, on behalf of my family, and especially <span class="mention person" about="PrinceCharles">Prince Charles</span> and <span class="mention person" about="PrinceWilliam">William</span> and <span class="mention person" about="PrinceHarry">Harry</span>, to thank all of you who have brought flowers, sent messages, and paid your respects in so many ways to a remarkable person." These utterances function to display the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s, and the Royal Family's, heartfelt emotions, selfless motives, and gratitude, bolstering their image.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Defeasibility</h2>
		<p>Some of her audience might still have wondered why she didn't speak up sooner. At one point the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> used the strategy of defeasibility to account for the lack of public response from the Royal Family. She explained, "It is not easy to express a sense of loss, since the initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings: disbelief, incomprehension, anger—and concern for those who remain." Thus, these feelings—shock, disbelief, incomprehension, anger—were diffcult to surmount, and are offered as an excuse for their initial reaction, or lack thereof.</p>
		
		<h2>Transcendence</h2>
		<p>Finally, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> attempted to direct her viewers' attention toward a larger issue: the world's perception of the British people, She explained that this tragedy and <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s funeral "is a chance to show to the whole world the British nation united in grief and respect. " This suggests that her subjects should band together to put on a united front to the rest of the world— rather than dwell on criticisms of the Royal Family. It gave them a reason to renew their bond with their monarch.</p>
		
		<h3>EVALUATION OF THE ROYAL IMAGE REPAIR EFFORT</h3>
		
		<p>We argue that this was a well-developed and appropriate response to the allegations and suspicions faced by the Royal Family. First, we believe the strategies are well chosen for this situation. It was incumbent upon the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> to deny these charges. She couldn't simply offer an excuse or try to justify a lack of feelings for the <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span> and her subjects. Denial was essential to this image repair effort. Furthermore, especially given growing concerns over the relevance and expense of the monarchy in recent years, it was appropriate for the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> to bolster herself and the Royal Family in this address. Defeasibility is a potentially useful strategy, noting the interference of factors beyond one's control. Finally, attempting to transcend current events to focus on issues that were arguably more important is a plausible strategy. Other potential responses—like attempting to minimize the people's concerns, or attacking the Royal Family's accusers—were inappropriate and the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> was wise to avoid them. Thus, we judge that the four strategies selected were appropriate.</p>
		
		<p>A second issue is how well the strategies were operationalized in the discourse itself. Some denials, for example, are simply more believable than others. We judge that <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> did a good job implementing these image repair strategies in her response. As noted above, this speech was an instance of rhetorical enactment, wherein the discourse itself—apart from (or in addition to) what was said in it—embodied a response to the accusations. This was a highly dramatic and especially effective response to the accusations. Obviously, the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> cared about her subjects: she was willing to take the risk of giving a virtually unprecedented speech to them! Her subjects responded well to this action. As <span class="mention person" about="Hamilton">Hamilton</span> and <span class="mention person" about="McGrory">McGrory</span> revealed, "The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> returned to <span class="mention place">London</span> to face her people. . , and they left her in do doubt that she was welcome. " Further, the specific instances of denial within the speech were appropriate as well. She sounded sincere and genuinely concerned about her people. She expressed her grief over <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>'s death as well as her concern for her subjects' feelings. Again, Britons responded favorably to the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s denials, as "there was widespread praise. . . for the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s broadcast, ranging from members of the peerage to the crowd outside <span class="mention place">Buckingham Palace.</span> "[32] Apparently the speech's viewers found it persuasive as well.</p>
		
		<p>Bolstering was also developed effectively in the speech. The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> indicated that she was speaking from her heart. She mentioned the family's concerns for <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s two children, and expressed her appreciation for her subjects' support. Furthermore, defeasibility provided a plausible excuse for the Royal Family's apparent lack ofresponse, and transcendence was a reasonable attempt to rally her subjects with an attractive appeal (a united <span class="mention place">Britain</span> facing the world). It was also a good decision to mention these last two strategies without dwelling on either (which may have appeared too defensive). Therefore, each of the four strategies was developed well in the discourse. Many in <span class="mention place">England</span> believed the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span> responded well to their concerns, and appreciated that she "opened her heart to her people . . . with a deeply-felt personal tribute to <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Diana</span>. " 3</p>
		
		<h3>IMPLICATIONS</h3>
		
		<p>In a day and age in which it seems that almost everyone is apologizing for something (for ignoring atrocities committed in <span class="mention event">World War Il</span>; for experiments performed on minorities; for biting an opponent in a prize fight; for referring to African-Americans as "black jelly beans; " 3 for having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a White House intern), some people and institutions are comparatively silent. <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Elizabeth Il</span>, Queen of England, has never before given a speech to repair her image, or the Royal Family's image. Of course, she didn't apologize here, but her rhetorical action was especially dramatic in large part because she had never done it before. Of course, if tragedy strikes again and a similar situation faces her in the future, this approach will not work as well. Still, the mere fact that she gave a speech about <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>'s death (and the Royal Family's reaction, or apparent lack thereof) gave this speech a tremendous power.</p>
		
		<p>This does not mean that she could have said anything (an offensive stance could have robbed the moment of its significance), but the situation, including the fact that such a speech was unprecedented, favored the <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>.</p>
		
		<p>She effectively denied the charges, provided a plausible excuse, and directed her viewers' attention to another, allegedly more important issue. She avoided strategies that would have caused resentment in her viewers (like minimization or attacking one's accusers). The speech was not simply adequate, not merely inoffensive, but positively well crafted to succinctly but distinctly make her point. This image repair effort was aided by circumstances, but was extremely well conceived as well.</p>
		
		<p>The idea of rhetorical enactment is a significant one. There are occasional circumstances in which the sheer fact of a rhetorical act—regardless of its details— functions persuasively in a rhetorical situation. We suspect that it is no coincidence that <span class="mention person" about="BarbaraJordan">Barbara Jordan</span>'s <time datetime="1976">1976</time> keynote speech (from an African-American woman) and <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span>'s image repair effort were unprecedented (in the case of <span class="mention person" about="KingEdwardVIII">King Edward VIII</span>, his speech occurred when he had already abdicated, and his brother had already become <span class="mention person" about="KingGeorgeVI">King George VI</span> ). [34] These two rhetorical acts had more "power" or impact because they were unusual. However, for this very reason, if a	second African-American woman, or another Queen, to give an image restoration discourse, it would not be as inherently effective. We speculate that there will probably be some spillover as well. When <span class="mention person" about="KatherineOrtega">Katherine Ortega</span> (a Hispanic woman) gave a Republican nominating convention keynote speech eight years after <span class="mention person" about="BarbaraJordan">Barbara Jordan</span>, even though she was a member of a different minority, we suspect the effect of rhetorical enactment was vastly dissipated from <time datetime="1976">1976</time>. Rhetorical enactment can be powerful, but it may be a fleeting phenomenon.</p>
		
		<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
		
		<p>After the tragic death of <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess Diana</span>, the British people grew increasingly incensed as the Royal Family seemed to ignore first the fallen <span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana">Princess</span> and then their subjects. Criticism of the Monarchy grew very heated, creating an enormous public relations problem. <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen Elizabeth</span> decided to make a historic, and completely unprecedented, rhetorical response to these accusations and criticisms. Her speech enacted one of her primary strategies, embodying a denial of the charge that the Royal Family did not care about<span class="mention person" about="PrincessDiana"> Princess Diana</span> or the British people and their grief. The <span class="mention person" about="QueenElizabethII">Queen</span>'s speech was remarkably well crafted: denying the accusations within the speech, bolstering her and the Royals, and briefly offering an excuse for their behavior and suggesting that the viewers turn their attention to another issue (the Britons united against the world). This case study clearly demonstrates that public relations are important concerns for the normally aloof royalty—and rightfully so.</p>
