					<h4>Theme 1: Blackletter - inspired by items from around the XVI century.</h4>
					<p>In the world of books, the word incunabula refers to books that were printed using metal type up to around 1530 - the year when a transformation in the appearance of books has begun. Johann Gutenberg is considered to be the inventor of typographic printing, i.e. of printing technology using metal type. His first actual printed book was the Bible.
					In this period, books were usually created for religious purposes, and were meant not only to be read, but to be appreciated by their beautiful decorative features.</p>
					<p>Firstly, this theme is inspired by a chronicle of church-liturgical books called Damaskin (Bulgarian: Дамаскин). They appeared at the end of the 16th century in the western Bulgarian lands and existed until the middle of the 19th century. Typically, damask is a type of decoration on a metal or leather handicraft whose etymology originates in the city of Damascus.</p> 

					<div class="row feature">
						<div class="large-5 column">
							<p>The damaskins are written in a simple, accessible, spoken vernacular and have a fascinating way of exhibiting. The name "damaskin" comes from the name of the first author of such a book - the Greek writer of the 16th century Damaskinos Stouditis, whose work "Thesauros" (Θησαυρός; 1558) contains 36 lives and teachings (printed in Venice).</p>
							<p>The second inspiration for this theme is the usage of the Gothic type in the texts - Blackletter is defined as a term used to explain and illustrate scripts from the Middle Ages. The characters that are used have dark characteristics that create a contrast with the whiteness of the page. These typefaces can be recognized from early manuscript writing by their dramatic thin and thick strokes, diagonal thin serifs on lowercase letters and, in some cases, elaborate swirling serifs on uppercase letters. This style of font is most commonly known from its first use in the Gothenburg Bible, one of the first books printed in Europe.</p>

					<h2>Key Aspects</h2>
					
					<div class="container-aspects">
						<h3>Incunabulas’ layout influence</h3>
							<p>Early printed books (incunabula) were produced in the same style as manuscripts, but the process was faster. The main reason for the increase of book production was the result of many changes and innovations in the design of books, in particular, a reduction in size, standardization of typefaces, addition of title pages and pagination, use of columns and margin notes, and rubrication at the beginning of the chapter.</p>

						<h3>Characteristic design</h3>
							<p>A definitive change in the appearance of books happened around 1530. In the design of the damaskin books we can notice that they differ from the manuscripts' layout. There are a few important characteristics in the Damaskin’s layout design, including:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>Position of the text: while incunabula had mainly a double-column layout on each page, the damaskin books were printed in one column. The composition is positioned slightly toward the left side of the page, with a wider right-hand margin that aesthetically anchors the negative space of the page rendering the visual impact exquisite and pleasing.</p></li>
									<li><p>Justified setting: damaskin’s layouts differed from early manuscripts in the justified setting.</p></li>
								</ul>
						 
						<h3>Decorative & stylized fonts</h3>
							<p>Most of the early typefaces were modeled on local styles of writing or were derived from various European Gothic scripts. Although, in the 16th century, the Roman typeface called "Old Style" was widely favored, the Gothic type was broadly used in medieval manuscripts, incunabula, damaskin books. The most distinctive feature of this style is that it is narrower in width than the preceding Carolingian script and has somewhat sharp corners. The word Gothic, ("like the Goths"), originated from the fact that Renaissance-period humanists considered the Gothic style rougher than the old Roman style and referred to the former as being "gothic."</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Font: The paragraphs are written in a font called Ruslan Display - a decorative, stylized, based on an ancient Russian script of the 16th century, which is called "poluustav."</p></li>
								<li><p>Rubrication: The artistic lettering in harmonic colors and variations in letter size for emphasis was also used in the damaskins - the decorative initial of the first word of each chapter was in large size and in red ink.</p></li>
							</ul>
						<h3>Recognizable colors</h3>
							<p>In the medieval period, black ink was the predominant color for manuscripts. However, the red ink was also widely used. In particular, dark red (hex #811112) was used for the decorative initials of every chapter, and of every new paragraph in the damaskin books. Furthermore, the descriptive text below the illustrations was also written in red ink. The illustrations were mainly colored in dark red, golden yellow and aquamarine blue ink, with black borders.</p>
						
						<h3>Golden ratio</h3>
							<p>The Golden Section is an aesthetically pleasing division of space that is often used by artists as the basis for measurements within their compositions. The text box sits in the upper section of the page, consistent with the reader's line of sight on a page, and giving space at the bottom, for the reader's hands to hold the book open without covering any content. These optical adjustments ensure that the text doesn’t appear to be falling off the bottom of the page.</p>

					<h4>Theme 2: Memphis - inspired by items from the late XX Century - The '80s trend.</h4>
					<p>Memphis, the short-lived design movement that entered the world in 1981 with the force of a runway show and faded out before the decade closed, was playful, an indifferent and insouciant break from tradition. The Memphis design was created by the Italian design and architecture group called the Memphis group. The founder of the group - Ettore Sottsass - together with other designers and architects, were trying to break away from modernist design and create more radical designs that would end up creating the aesthetic of the 1980s.</p>
					
					<h5>The Memphis Group's designs defined the boundary-pushing postmodernism of the '80s - bright colours, vibrant patterns and bold graphic forms.</h5>
					
					<p>Like many creative movements, Memphis was a reaction against the status quo. The 1950s/1960s mid-century modern and 1970s minimalism were about structure and straight lines. To counter that, Sottsass centered the group's thinking around <b>“radical, funny, and outrageous”</b>—essentially, disregarding what was considered in “good taste” at that time. The geometric figures of <i>Art Deco</i>, the color palette of <i>Pop Art</i>, and 1950s kitsch inspired their unusual aesthetic.</p>
					
					<p>The Memphis style is a mix of various design styles - patterns, textures, color fonts, geometric shapes and bold colors.</p>

					<blockquote>The Memphis style is all about taking a <b>bold</b> and <u>brash</u> approach to design.</blockquote>

					<h2>Key Aspects</h2>
					
					<div class="container-aspects">
						<h3>Geometric shapes, primary art element</h3>
							<p>Memphis design is packed with different geometric shapes - sharp elements in the foreground to intricate patterns. These elements are often free-flowing in nature and don’t seem to have a defined grid or pattern.</p>
							<p>Shapes include squares, circles and triangles and can have sharp edges, or even a hand-drawn look. Here, some patterns follow the popular “pill” shape, and others are a combination of paired shapes.</p>

						<h3>Highly visual sans serif typefaces</h3>
							<p>Typography should mimic the other elements of the design. The use of letterforms with some geometric look, as well as fonts with stroke widths, highlight the similarity in shape and size to the patterns of the design.</p>
							<p>The chosen typefaces - styles with an 80s flair - are bold, blocky sans serifs and bubble lettering for the articles' title.</p>
						 
						<h3>Strokes and Squiggles, visual effects</h3>
							<p>Thick strokes and squiggles are one of the key identifying factors. A series of strokes and lines that seem to freely fill the design.</p>
							<p>Coloring for these elements is the one real variant. Black, white or in full color, the design is created so that these little geometric figures have a lot of contrast.</p>
						
						<h3>Color choices - less primary, more fluorescent</h3>
							<p>The Memphis design is characterized with bright, saturated color choices - yellow, orange and teal. The idea is to evoke strong emotions of joy and happiness in readers.</p>
							<p>In addition to these bright colors, the Memphis design follows a minimalist color pattern, certain lines and geometric shapes in black and white, as the primary colors.</p>
